You are extracting knowledge from one Claude Code session for the project at `{{PROJECT_PATH}}`. You do NOT have filesystem tools — the transcript is inlined below. Emit ONE `WikiActionEnvelope` v2 JSON document to stdout.

## Session

- Session IDs (echo into meta and `sources:`): {{SESSION_ID_LIST}}
- Project path: {{PROJECT_PATH}}

## Related sessions from this project

{{RELATED_SESSIONS}}

## What to extract

- Project-specific decisions, patterns, learnings discovered in this session.
- Architecture or tool choices unique to this project.
- Bugs found + their root causes.
- Failure traces (when present): what was tried and didn't work, and why; the conditions under which the chosen approach breaks. Not just the final fix — include this alongside it, not instead of it. Skip if the source has nothing of the kind.

**Skip** conversation summaries and routine code changes.

## Output schema

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "entity": "short label",
  "actions": [
    {
      "op": "create",
      "path": "decisions/<slug>.md",
      "content": "---\n<yaml fields>\n---\n\n<body>"
    }
  ],
  "meta": [
    {"op": "sessions_log_append", "session_id": "<sid>"},
    {"op": "rolling_memory_append", "domain": "general", "target": "learnings", "content": "..."}
  ]
}
```

## Rules

- Always emit one `sessions_log_append` per session id in `SESSION_ID_LIST`.
- Frontmatter: `title`, `type`, `created: {{TODAY}}`, `updated: {{TODAY}}`, `domain: general`, `confidence`, `tags` (≥3), `related` (array of `"[[Title]]"` strings), `sources` (array containing `session:<id>`).
- Allowed `type` values (exactly one): decision, pattern, solution, research, tool, project, idea, person. The directory MUST match the type — decisions/→decision, patterns/→pattern, solutions/→solution, research/→research, tools/→tool, ideas/→idea, people/→person.
- ≤150 lines per article. Quote claims with `> "..."\n> — Source: session:<id>`.
- NEVER target a file whose basename starts with `_` (e.g. `_index.md`, `_backlinks.json`, `_absorb_log.json`) — scribe generates these and the executor rejects writes to them. Use `create` for a new file; `append` only for a file you were shown exists.
- For rolling_memory_append, target must be `learnings` or `decisions-log`.

## Avoid duplicates

- One topic = one article: never emit two `create` actions with near-identical titles or slugs.
- If a relevant article is visible in the context you were given (related sessions, inlined files, any article path shown), extend it via `append`/`replace_section` instead of creating a parallel page, and reuse its exact title in `related:` wikilinks.
- Generic knowledge that almost certainly has a page already (well-known patterns, common tool facts) does not get a new stub — fold it into `rolling_memory_append` where available, or drop it. A near-duplicate page splits future updates across files and corrupts contradiction resolution.

## Output reminder

Stdout must be ONE JSON object matching `WikiActionEnvelope` v2. No prose. No code fences.
